# My Travel Check list React App

The foundation of the project is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This creates the base file structure for src code, packages, and includes easily integrated options. For a single HTML page could be used with script tags injecting ReactJS into the page, but the structuring of this provides a cleaner implementation.



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
